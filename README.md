    <h1>About a basketball</h1>
    <div style="border: 3px solid; margin: 25px; color: blue;">
    <p>The main objective is to outscore the opposing team. Points are scored by making a basket, which is a hoop 10 feet off the ground. A shot made from inside the three-point arc is worth two points, while a shot from outside the arc is worth three points. If a player is fouled while shooting and misses, they get to take one or more free throws from the foul line, with each successful free throw being worth one point.</p>

    <p>Shooting: The most direct way to score points. It involves getting the ball into the basket from various distances and angles, including layups, jump shots, and free throws.</p>
    <p>Dribbling: This is the act of bouncing the ball on the floor to move around the court while maintaining control. Skilled dribblers can change direction quickly, protect the ball from defenders, and create space to shoot or pass.</p>
    <p>Passing: The ability to throw the ball accurately and effectively to a teammate. Different types of passes, such as the chest pass, bounce pass, and overhead pass, are used for different situations to move the ball and find open teammates.</p>
    <p>Rebounding: The act of gaining possession of the ball after a missed shot. Offensive rebounding gives your team a second chance to score.</p>
    <p>Footwork: The foundational skill that underlies all offensive moves. Proper footwork is essential for a balanced shot, a quick first step to drive past a defender, and pivoting to protect the ball.</p>
